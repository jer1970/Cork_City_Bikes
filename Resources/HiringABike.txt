To Hire a City Bike
The City Bike service is available all year 7 days a week, from 5am to 12.30am, though a bike can be returned to available stands at any time of the day.

Log in with either your Subscriber Access number from your 3 Day pass , or present your Membership Card to the card reader on the terminal, then enter your PIN code.
Choose the Bike you wish to use by means of the stand number of an available CityBike.
You are then given the code for the combination lock provided on the City Bike, if you need to use it. If you lose this number it can be retrieved by calling 0818 44 44 77 as detailed on the City Bike's basket.
The City Bike can then be removed from the stand, by pressing the button on the chosen stand. You have 60 seconds to press the button, then 5 seconds to remove the City Bike, before the stand automatically locks again. But don't worry, if you miss it at first, you can repeat the process again.
Then please check the City Bike over, make sure it is working fine, adjust the saddle to your height and enjoy the cycle, but please cycle safely.
